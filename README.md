# Sparkle

## Basic Usage

### With Three.js

```js
var emitter, velocity = new SPARKLE.SphereZone( 10, 10, 10 );
scene.add( emitter = new SPARKLE.THREE.Emitter( {
    count : 1000,
    lifeTime : [ 1, 1.5 ],
    fading : true,
    color : new THREE.Color( 0x220000 ),
    velocity : velocity
} ) );

var render = function ( ) {
    window.requestAnimationFrame( render );
    emitter.update( clock.getDelta( ) );
    renderer.render( scene, camera );
};
```

### Without Three.js

```js
var emitter = new SPARKLE.Emitter( );

emitter.initializer( new SPARKLE.LifeTimeInitializer( 1, 1.15 ) );
emitter.initializer( new SPARKLE.VelocityInitializer( new SPARKLE.SphereZone( 10, 10, 10 ) ) );

emitter.action( new SPARKLE.AgeingAction( ) );
emitter.action( new SPARKLE.DisplacementAction( ) );
emitter.action( new SPARKLE.FadingAction( ) );

emitter.onWakeUp = myCustomRenderer.onWakeUp;
emitter.onUpdate = myCustomRenderer.onUpdate;
emitter.onSleep = myCustomRenderer.onSleep;

emitter.spawn( 1000, 10 );

setInterval( function ( ) {
    emitter.update( 1000 / 60 );
}, 1000 / 60 );
```

## Reference

### Initializers

They are called during particle creation & destruction. They contain the two following methods :

 - `initialize( particle )`, which is called at the particle creation.
 - `discard( particle )`, which is called at the particle destruction.

#### `SPARKLE.LambdaInitializer( fn [, context] )`

Will call `fn` with target `context` when the particle will be initialized.

#### `SPARKLE.LifeTimeInitializer( min, max )`

Will set the lifetime of the particle to a random value between `min` and `max`.

#### `SPARKLE.PositionInitializer( zone )`

Will set the particle position to a random point inside `zone`.

#### `SPARKLE.VelocityInitializer( zone )`

Will set the particle velocity to a random value from `zone`.

### Actions

They are called at each frame. They contain the following method :

- `update( particle, delta )`, which can do whatever synchronous action you want.

#### `SPARKLE.AccelerationAction( zone )`

Constantly increase particle velocity. Requires a Velocity initializer.

#### `SPARKLE.AgeingAction( )`

Make particle ageing, then kill it. Requires a LifeTime initializer.

#### `SPARKLE.DisplacementAction( )`

Make particle move. Requires Position and Velocity initializers.

#### `SPARKLE.FadingAction( [ fn ] )`

Make particle opacity change according to its age. `fn` can be a function which takes the particle age (in a `[0 ; 1]` range), and returns its opacity. Requires a LifeTime initializer.

### Zones

They represent a geometrical shape. They contain the two following methods :

- `random( )`, which has to return a random coordinate inside the zone.
- `free( coord )`, which dispose the coordinate.

#### `SPARKLE.AsyncZone( fn )`

Immediately calls `fn`, passing it a function as parameter. This function takes a Zone as parameter, and set it as the 'real' zone.

As long as this callback is not alled, the AsyncZone will always return a null position.

#### `SPARKLE.CuboidZone( sx, sy, sz [, inner ] )`

Represents a cuboid.

#### `SPARKLE.LineZone( bx, by, bz, ex, ey, ez )`

Represents a line.

#### `SPARKLE.PointZone( x, y, z )`

Represents a point.

#### `SPARKLE.SphereZone( r, inner, uniform )`

Represents a sphere.

#### `SPARKLE.THREE.GeometryZone( geometry )` (Three.js only)

Represents a Three.js geometry.

The points will always be at the surface of the geometry.
